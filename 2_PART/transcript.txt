Good morning everyone.

Let’s start today’s meeting by reviewing the current project timeline and overall progress.

The backend development is progressing well.
Most of the core APIs are already implemented, and the remaining work is expected to be completed by next Friday.
Some validation and error-handling tasks are still pending and need to be finalized before integration.

On the frontend side, the UI changes are still pending.
The design team needs to review the latest requirements and finalize the updated screens.
Once the designs are approved, the frontend implementation can start immediately.

Hemant will handle the API integration.
He will coordinate with the frontend team to ensure smooth communication.
Hemant will also prepare basic API documentation to support testing.

We also discussed the testing and deployment plan.
The QA team will begin testing after backend and frontend integration is completed.
Any critical issues identified during testing should be reported immediately.

The deployment will first be done in the staging environment.
After final approval, the application will be deployed to production.

Our next meeting is scheduled for Monday.
Please make sure all assigned tasks are updated before the next meeting.

Thank you everyone for your time.
Let’s stay aligned and keep the momentum going.
